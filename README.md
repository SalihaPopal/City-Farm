# City-Farm

Business problem


A city farm has volunteers who look after its animals. Every day, one volunteer is needed every morning and every evening to feed the animals.



We need a website to ensure that every session has exactly one volunteer signed up.



User roles



Manager - ultimately responsible for ensuring every time slot has a volunteer.
Volunteer - can sign up for sessions.



User stories
As a manager, I need to be able to see if any sessions don't have a volunteer signed up.
As a manager, I need to be able to see the name, email, and phone number of the person who signed up to any session.
As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions are available to sign up to volunteer.
As a volunteer, I need to be able to see what sessions I have signed up for.
As a volunteer, I need to be able to claim an available session.
As a volunteer, I need to be able to cancel a session I have already signed up for.
As a manager, I need to be notified if someone cancels a session at short notice.
As a volunteer, I don't want any other volunteer to know when I am volunteering, to protect my privacy.
Stretch User Stories
As a volunteer, I get a notification (perhaps by email or SMS) to remind me about my session.
As a manager, I can view statistics around how often each volunteer volunteers.
As a volunteer, I can sign up to sessions on a schedule, e.g. "Every Monday morning".
As a manager, I want to be able to email all upcoming volunteers with some information.



Table stakes



Unrelated to any one user story, the following requirements must always be met:
The website must be deployed somewhere where it's accessible to anyone with internet access.
The website must be fully accessible.
If an error occurs, it must be obvious to the user that something has gone wrong, and what they should do about it.
Any data must be persisted - re-deploying or re-starting the server must not lose any data.
Short-cuts we can take
Let's not worry about log-in for now. We can just have a button/drop-down in the corner of the screen to switch between manager and volunteer roles.



Suggested implementation plan



Talk through what functionality should live where.
Sketch out some wire-frames to map out the user experience.
Model the data in database tables.
Choose some user stories to focus on first, and:
Write backend features which you can test out with curl/postman.
Add frontend features to visualise the data from the backend and interact with it.
Deploy everything.
Iterate.
